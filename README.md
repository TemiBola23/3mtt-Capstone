## What this project does

* Register and log in with a secure account
* Browse, search and filter movies from the TMDB database
* Save favourites and create watchlists
* Rate and review titles
* Mobile friendly interface

The backend exposes a REST API using Express and stores data in MongoDB. The frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS and communicates with the API using JWT authentication.
Stretch ideas include social features, improved recommendations, movie trailers via the YouTube API and turning the app into a PWA.

## How it was built

1. **Set up the backend** – created an Express server with routes for auth, movies, users and watchlists. Connected MongoDB with Mongoose and protected endpoints with JWT.
2. **Create the frontend** – bootstrapped a React project using Vite and styled it with Tailwind CSS and styled‑components. Added pages for browsing movies, viewing details and managing accounts.
3. **Fetch movie data** – integrated the TMDB API so users can search by title, genre or year and see full details including posters.
4. **Add user features** – implemented saving favourites, custom lists, ratings and reviews so each user can personalise their library.
5. **Make it responsive** – tested on mobile and desktop, ensuring the layout adapts well to smaller screens.
6. **Deploy** – hosted the frontend on Vercel and the backend on Render. Environment variables are used for all secrets.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Kanegraffiti/3mtt-Capstone.git
cd 3mtt-Capstone

# 2. Install backend then frontend dependencies
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install

# 3. Create .env files for server and client
#    (see examples in each folder)

# 4. Start the development servers
npm --prefix server run dev     # backend on port 5000
npm --prefix client run dev -- --host  # frontend on port 3000
```

Open the printed Vite network URL in your browser to see the site. When you are ready for production, run `npm --prefix client run build` and deploy the `client/dist` folder to Vercel. The backend can be deployed to Render or another Node host.
